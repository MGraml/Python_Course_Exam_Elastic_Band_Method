This project was dedicated to explore the wild landscape of... Anything which one provides as a .csv-file.
No matter if we talk about arctic water between frozen icebergs, bobbing up and down, rocky hills in front of the Himalaya or dusty desert with suffocating sand, we will be able to plot the right pathway to rescue our princess (which is somehow lost in the mountains, I guess due to Smaug).

We are also able to find a way through the protective trenches and deliver an important cipher to the General:

But be advised: This one will put you in great jeopardy and the former soldiers didn't make it... Maybe it would be good to take more time, be more patient and decrease your force constant k!

Sadly, the soldiers which took that way, lost track of their duty and spent their remaining life in the deep Donnerbalken pit.
It would be wise to find a compromise between these ways and deliver your message!

Congratulations!
You have now successfully delivered the cipher to the general!
Without you, the whole battalion would have perished in the devastating fire of the enemies mortars...
Luckily, the general is now aware of the hot spots, which are targeted by the enemy and which exactly cross the red planned line of advance.
The general is showing you the new blue route for invasion and gives the command...
